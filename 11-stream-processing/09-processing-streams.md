# Processing Streams

## Things we can do with event stream

- Can take data in the events and write it to database,cache,search index or similar storage systems from where it can be queried by other clients.

- Push events to user in some way for example by sending email, alerts or push notifications or to a realtime dashboaed where it can be visualized.

- Can process one or more input streams to produce one or more output streams. Streams can go through pipeline of several processing stages before they end as output.
