# Fault Tolerant Consensus

- A consensus algorithm must satisfy the following properties

**Uniform agreement**: No two nodes decide differently

**Integrity**: No node decides twice

**Validity**: If node decides value v, then v was proposed by some node.

**Termination**: Every node that doesn't crash eventually decides some value.
