# Consistency Guarantees

- Eventual consistency is hard for developers becuase it is different from behaviour of variables in a normal single threaded program .

- If we assign a value to a variable and read again in sometime and data is not there it leads to lot of confusion.  A database superficially like a variable that we can read and write, but has more complicated semantics.
