# Three Phase commit

- Two phase commit is called a blocking atomic protocol due to the fact that 2PC 
can become stuck while waiting for cordinator to recover.

- It is possible to make an atomic protocol nonblocking so it doesnt get stuck if a node fails 

- Alternative to 2PC algorithm called three-phase-commit (3PC).

- 3PC assumes network with bounded delay and nodes with bounded response times, in most pratical systems with 
unbounded network delays it cannot guarantee atomicity.

- Non blocking atomic commit requires a **perfect failure detector** . A reliable mechanism for telling whether 
the node has crashed or not . In a network with unbounded delay a timeout is not reliable failure detector. 

- 2PC is used in pratice due to this issue
